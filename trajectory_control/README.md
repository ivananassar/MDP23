# Trajectory Control
Trajectory generation and control algorithms for UAVs with ROS wrapping.

The project uses external software such as Mavros. Below are the links directing to their documentations.

## Installation
For the installation, you need to have ROS melodic (or kinetic) installed, a catkin workspace and Gazebo. Follow the online documentation to set up your environement.

[ROS Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu)

[Catkin Workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace)

[Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu&cat=install)

### Prerequisites
Install mavros

```bash
sudo apt install ros-melodic-mavros ros-melodic-mavros-extras
```

Mavros request the GeographicLib datasets, install it by running the install_geographiclib_datasets.sh script

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mavlink/mavros/master/mavros/scripts/install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
chmod +x install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
sudo ./install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
```
Install libgstreamer

```bash
sudo apt install libgstreamer1.0-dev
```

Initialize rosdep and update it

```bash
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

Clone sitl_gazebo and PX4 Firmware

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
git clone --recursive https://github.com/PX4/sitl_gazebo
git clone --recursive https://github.com/PX4/Firmware px4
```

**Note:** If you have troubles installing the different packages, it is recommended to read the related documentation.

### Install trajectory_control
Clone the trajectory_control repository
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
git clone https://github.com/gipsa-lab-uav/trajectory_control
```

Don't forget to install the required Python packages, with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And then continue the installation:
```bash
cd ..
catkin_make
```

Then source your setup.bash

```bash
source devel/setup.bash
```

## Testing the installation
On one terminal, run the following launch file:
```bash
roslaunch trajectory_control trajectory_control_example.launch
```

A gazebo window should open with the iris model along with a window displaying live information sush as the thrust, and a window with a generated trajectory. Close the generated trajectory window. In the gazebo window, the iris quadcopter should takeoff and start the trajectory. You can open QGroundControl in parallel also to check if everything is interfacing correctly.

## Troubleshooting

### catkin_make

In case of issue with catkin_make it is advisable to launch it with the ```VERBOSE=1``` option

If performance issues don't allow for the computer to finish `catkin_make`, it is possible to reduce the compiler usage on the computer, using the `-j` option. Use the `nproc` command to get the number of CPU cores/threads available. Example:

```bash
nproc
>> 8
catkin_make -j2
```

### rosdep

If an error of type 'cannot download default sources list from: ... Website may be down' occurs

```bash
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates
```

If it still does not work, try to update your system date/clock

### Gazebo

Run Gazebo with the verbose option to get more information on issues `gazebo --verbose`. If Gazebo process dies at the start, it might be a symbol lookup error. Upgrade all your package and try again.

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```
